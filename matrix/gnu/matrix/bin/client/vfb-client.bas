Many of the operations covered in the Ô¨Årst few chapters, especially the
transformations and factorizations in Chap. 5, are important because of their
use in solving systems of linear equations, which will be discussed in Chap. 6;
in computing eigenvectors, eigenvalues, and singular values, which will be
discussed in Chap. 7; and in the applications in Chap. 9.
